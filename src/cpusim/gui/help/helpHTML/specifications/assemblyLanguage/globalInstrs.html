        FACE="Palatino"><P>The word ".global" signifies a pseudo-instruction in assembly language. It provides a way for
    the user to declare a specific label's scope to be global (it can be referenced in code from the original file
    or any files included in the original file. The pseudoinstruction has
    the following parts:</FONT>
<DIR><FONT FACE="Palatino">
    <B>.global <I>label name</I></B></FONT></DIR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">

    <P>The word ".global" and the label name must be included, but the comment is optional. The label can be
        used as an operand in assembly language statements to refer to the first address of the data that is being
        specified. The pseudoinstruction is terminated by the end-of-line character.</P>

    <P>The operand must be a string of 0 or more characters. The string cannot include the
        end-of-line or double-quote characters:</P></FONT><PRE>
	.global  Start   ; legal
	.global  Sta"rt  ; illegal--contains a double quote character.

</PRE>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">The effect of including an Global pseudoinstruction in your program is that the assembler remembers
the specified label and do not replace it with a unique label in another file, but rather preserves its
name so that the scope of the variable will truly be global.
So the first example pseudoinstruction above will allow for any file to jump to the label Start, wherever
that label happens to be declared.</FONT>
